# This is my angular portfolio project
In this project, I showcase my skills in angular routing, html, css and typescript.
I used the service tool to consume "(https://api.github.com/users)" to show the username, image and link to their profile.
I used some authentication for the form so that an alert is raised when 2 fields are not filled properly.


# Issues faced
I tried to implement the node.js as server.ts so I can send an email when the contact form is submitted.
I still have not figured that out yet, but I will def.
I tried to implement a search component to directly search for github username and display the information directly from github database, I don't know where to get the api.

# Lesson learnt
Building an application is easy and at the same time difficult.
I will keep practicing to have hands on experience.
I think I prefer Angular to the other frontend frameworks like react and Next.js
